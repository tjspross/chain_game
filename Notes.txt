In order to get a controller object at the bottom of the chain that moves the chain around but can't break away from it

1. Create a rigid body that can be controlled by the mouse.
	a. the movements of the mouse should put forces on the object, but not move it directly.
	b. the mouse will need to be locked into the play area
	c. might be easiest to begin with keyboard controls instead of mouse.
2. attach this body to the bottom of several chain link rigid bodies with pinjoints
	b. will need to make sure whatever forces can be put on the controller can't overcome the forces of the pinjoints.
